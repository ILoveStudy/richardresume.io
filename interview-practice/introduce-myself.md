# Let me introduce myself first.



My name is Gong Hanjin and I am from Guangxi Province, China. I am a minority in China. I am a Zhuang nationality.

My family lives in a very remote mountainous area in Guangxi. There is inconvenient transportation and the economy is backward.

I can only work very hard to find my way through the entrance examination...



From 2007 to 2010, I successfully graduated from Shanghai University of Science and Technology. My major is the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences.



After graduating in 2010, I got the first software development job in my life through unremitting efforts.

Until now, I have been in software development for 11 years.



You may ask me: "You are not a computer-related major, how can you do software development?"



In fact, when I was in high school, I had already started to learn programming knowledge outside of school. The first computer language I learned was VB.



During college, I would go to a computer major class to attend classes. Then, I would buy a lot of cutting-edge computer-related books outside of class for study.





Until now, I have 11 years of software development experience. My main languages are java and typescript.



In the past few years, my main role was the head of technology.



I am currently employed. I work for a software service company in Tokyo. This company is called nisshin, and the alias is smartcompany.jp
